= BI-PYT

== How to start

. Clone this repository
. Install Conda
** link:https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html[Miniconda]
** link:https://www.anaconda.com/distribution[Anaconda]
. In terminal (or conda prompt) go into cloned directory `cd bi-pyt`
. Install (or update) environment `conda env update`
. Activate the environment `source activate bipyt`
. Run jupyter notebook `jupyter notebook`
. Enjoy programming ;)

== Each laboratory

At the beginning of the laboratory, pull assignments and create a new branch in which you will work. 

. Switch to master branch `git checkout master`
. Pull assigments `git pull`
. Create a new branch for laboratory `git checkout -b branch_name`
. Activate the environment `conda activate bipyt`
. Run jupyter notebook `jupyter notebook`
. Enjoy programming ;)
 

After the lab, we recommend you to save your code to gitlab.

```
git status # show changes
git add your_lab_notebook.ipynb # add file(s) to the staging area
git commit -m 'Message' # commit the changes to the local repositort
git push origin branch_name # push changes to remote repository
```

== Homeworks

There is a separate folder for each homework. New folders will be created for you as new homeworks are assigned.

Similar to each laboratory create a **special branch** for each homework (e.g. homework01) and work in this branch. After the homework is finished, commit and push your homework branch to faculty Gitlab.

On Gitlab, create a Merge request from your branch to master: 

. (Left Menu) Merge Requests -> New merge request
.. Source branch will be _your repo_ and **homework branch** (eg. homework01).
.. Target branch will be also _your repo_ and branch **master**.
. Then click "Compare branches and continue" and "Submit merge request".
