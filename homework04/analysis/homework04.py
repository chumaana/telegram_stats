In this homework, we will use well-known Titanic dataset which contains 
information about passengers of Titanic. The dataset consists of personal 
information about each passenger and indicator whether the passenger 
survived. We will use this data to analyse passenger list and their chance for
survival.

The provided dataset contains the following attributes:
 'Age' - age in years,
 'Fare' - fare ticked price,
 'Name' - passenger name,
 'Parch' - # of parents/children of a person on board,
 'PassengerId' - identifier,
 'Pclass' - travelling class, 1 = 1. class, 2 = 2. class, 3 = 3. class,
 'Sex' - sex,
 'SibSp' - # siblings/spouses on board,
 'Survived' - 0 = died, 1 = survived,
 'Embarked' - boarding port C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton,
'Cabin' - cabin number
 'Ticket' - ticket number

    Write a function which loads CSV from two files to pandas DataFrame and

def get_missing_values(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    When working and analysing data, one often needs to deal with missing
    values. For example, some passengers did not fill information about
    family members. In that case, one needs to be aware of it as it may
    introduce bias to the data.

    Write a function which determines the number of missing values in given
    DataFrame. The function should output a new DataFrame. The new DataFrame
    should be indexed by columns of original DataFrame. Columns of returned
    DataFrame will be (keep the order of the columns):
        1. "Total" - contains the number of missing values
        2. "Percent" - contains the percentage of missing values with regard to all
        rows of given DataFrame.

    Sort the resulting DataFrame based on the number of missing values from
    largest to smallest.
    
    Example of output:

               |  Total  |  Percent

    One way how to handle missing data is to substitute missing values with

        1. "Age" - fill missing values with the mean of other rows.
        2. "Fare" - fill missing values with the lowest price of ~$15 (we
        suppose that the majority of unregistered tickets were the cheapest

    The result will be returned as one number.

    Pearson correlation coefficient quantifies linear relationship between
    two random variables. Correlation ranges from -1 to 1. Value around zero
    indicates no linear relationship, -1 indicates strong negative
    relationship, 1 indicates strong relationship.
